Linguistic Geometry
===================

Dr. Boris Stilman's body of work has been focused on a type of game theory 
and artificial intelligence algorithms he has title "Linguistic Geometry".
The premise is that utilizing controlled grammars, effective strategies for
victory in an "abstract board game' with 2 sides and a concrete set of rules 
for movement and attack. His research was originally in chess, but he now
applies his findings to military applications.

This project covers the various aspects fo devising the effective strategies.

Project 1
---------

Generates reachability tables for all chess pieces - these tables represent the
number of movements a chess piece needs to make to reach a certain location.

Project 2
---------

Generate trajectories for a board with and without obstacles.
Generate trajectories for a king from a5 to h5.

Project 3
---------

Generate zones of trajectories for two different chess board setups.

Project 4
---------

Generate translations utilizing grammar of reduced searches.

Project 5
---------

Solve the Reti endgame and display state space.
